# PoliciesAndClient
Back-End Assessment

How To Run the Proyect:

Clone the repository https://github.com/ManuelRios94/PoliciesAndClient.git (If you need herl, visit https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

Go to the folder where it was installed and run the command "npm install"

Run the command "npm start" 3.1) If you want to run unit test enter the command "npm test"

The application will run in http://localhost:3000/

Technical Notes:

- I decided to always consult the API (Url Clients and Policies), in case it changes the data in the future.

- I assume that the id and name of the customer data are a unique identifier
